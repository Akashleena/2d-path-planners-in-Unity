Dijkstra

GenerateGrid.cs {depends on DijkstraNode.cs} [GameObject GridGenerator] - generates the Grid with nodes and the neighbouring nodes
ShortestPath.cs [attached to GameObject controller]- takes in start and end node (Transform or positions) from PlayerScript and returns the grid positions to PlayerScript.cs
nodes- GameObject taggged as Node
DijkstraNode.cs - generic class with function prototypes defined 

PlayerScript -> ShortestPath -> DijkstraNode
GenerateGrid [common for all]
